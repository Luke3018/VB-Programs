<p>PC gaming has become very popular in the recent decade. 
There is a variety of games out there meaning a game can be found for everyone. 
PC’s range widely from low end (costing £500 or less) to high end systems (costing £1000 and more) 
but the games can be run on all systems. PCs are easily customised to upgrade the class of a gaming system 
and improve the gaming experience. Esports is the competitive side of PC gaming where people test their 
skills against others for money, although it has been around for a long time it has really 
grown over the last decade. The game of the year award and the golden joystick award are the biggest 
award a video game can win, Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (in the centre of the image) won both in 2015 (the year it was released).</p>

<p>On the left is a collage of some of my favourite PC games that have come out over the past 18 years. 
Most of these games are classed as triple-A (AAA), meaning they had a big budget and where developed by the top developers, 
such as Ubisoft (Assassins creed), Bethesda (Fallout4, Doom, Wolfenstein). 
Some where top games but developed by companies not as big CD Projekt RED (Witcher3: Wild Hunt), Valve (portal 2).   </p>
